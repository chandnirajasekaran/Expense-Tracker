# Expense Tracker
Expense Tracker is an iOS mobile application that allows users to track day-to-day expenses. It is aimed to support students transitioning to a more 
financially independent lifestyle in college. This app allows users to store their expense data (item name, price and date) for each purchase. Each user's data is stored in the Clourd Firestore database for user to access with appropriate log-in credentials. Expense Tracker allows for authentication with both Google and email.
